# Bayesian Reconstruction of Fourier Pairs

This is the source code for Bayesian Reconstruction of Fourier Pairs (BRFP) based on python.
We can reconstruct time-frequency signals using time or frequency (or both of them) noisely-observations under an unevenly sample scenario.

## DONE:
* 1D time to spectrum example
## TODO
* 1D spectrum to time example
* 1D spectrum and time reconstruction
* 2D spectrum to space-domain reconstruction
